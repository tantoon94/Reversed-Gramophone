# CASA0016 - Reversed Gramophone - ReadMe File 

## What is the Reversed Gramophone?

This device is an experimental project aiming to visualise sound physically in real-time. Although various software exists that visualizes sound using digital tools and algorithms, it has been a challenge to materialize the effect of sound and make it visible without using a digital screen. Many artists and technicians have stemmed projects with the same goal. An example would be the experiments with salt and water to make sound visible through cymatics. However, the momentary nature of the sound made it difficult to capture a continuous sound like a music peace for instance. Therefore, this project was introduced to capture not only the momentary notes and pitches of the sound in real-time but also to visualise the recorded waves on a histogram that could show the overall look of the sound in time.

##  Replace the Tags on the side menu of GitHub

Put some tags in to make your site more searchable in GitHub

## Include A Section That Tells Developers How To Install The App

### Windows developers
Just double click the "deploy.bat", the web could be created by your own computer, hopefully everything would be done

### Raspberry Pi
CD to the Project by: `cd ~/Desktop/casa0017-web-TiTan-6`
Run the "deploy.sh", the lasted "main" branch would be download from git, and then it would build the web auto
